        <!-- projectile motion, no air resistance-->
        <!-- for display set a min height and width, maybe do 1meter = __ pixels?-->
        <!-- with variable launch angle and initial velocity, (mass, gravity)
                - display all-->
        <!-- calculate max distance and height
                - display max distance and height for time-->
        <!-- draw a parabola for path of motion
                - display n evenly spaced (w/ respect to time) points on parabola for x,y,t values-->
        <!-- NOTE, cannot do this for air resistance because path is not a parabola, would need diff eq and approximations for this-->
